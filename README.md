# Deeper Details

**Component maturity: ðŸŸ¡ Beta**

A round of internal testing and external feedback has resulted in significant changes. With a clearer direction, new changes are likely to be smaller, and less likely to be breaking changes. But still, use this at your own risk until itâ€™s marked as stable.

## Overview

`deeper-details` is a web component built using the Lit library. It provides an expandable/collapsible section of content, allowing users to toggle visibility with custom buttons. Itâ€™s designed for long-form contentâ€”like UX Portfolio case studies, where some readers can only skim content, and other readers want to see more detailed information.

The elementâ€™s architectural goals are to be:
* Headless
* Declarative
* Brand-agnostic
* Framework-agnostic

## Features
* Expand and collapse content with a toggle button.
* Customizable button labels and styles, using CSS Custom Properties.
* Smooth transition animations.
* Support for accessibility, utilizing ARIA attributes

## Installation
You can install deeper-details via npm or yarn.

```sh
npm install deeper-details
```

or

```sh
yarn add deeper-details
```

## Usage
First, import the component in your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```javascript
import 'deeper-details';
```

Then, use the component in your HTML:

Example:
```html
<deeper-details>
  <button class="your-button-class" slot="expand-button">Show more</button>
  <button class="your-button-class" slot="hide-button">Show less</button>
  <div>Content to be toggled</div>
</deeper-details>
```

For front end frameworks, you likely need to follow instructions for adding a custom element for your framework (e.g. Next, Nuxt, Astro, etc.).

### Slots
If you need more flexibility to style the buttons, you can replace them with your own, using slots!
* Default slot: The content to be expanded/collapsed
* *expand-button*: Custom element for the expand button
* *hide-button*: Custom element for the hide button

### CSS Custom Properties
If you need to re-style some elements inside the ShadowDOM, here are some properties you can override:

* *--deeperDetails-toggle-transition*: Transition for toggle elements. _Default: opacity 200ms linear_
* *--deeperDetails-opacity--hidden*: Opacity of hidden content. _Default: 0_
* *--deeperDetails-contentWrapper-animation*: Custom animation for content wrapper
