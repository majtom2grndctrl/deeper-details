# Deeper Details
`deeper-details` is a web component built using the Lit library. It provides an expandable/collapsible section of content, allowing users to toggle visibility with custom buttons. Unlike other progressive disclosure components, this is designed for long-form contentâ€”like UX Portfolio case studies, where some readers can only skim content, and other readers want to see deeper details.

## Features
* Expand and collapse content with a toggle button.
* Customizable button labels and styles, using CSS Custom Properies.
* Smooth transition animations.
* Built with Lit, ensuring high performance and ease of use.

## Installation
You can install deeper-details via npm or yarn.

```sh
npm install deeper-details
```

or

```sh
yarn add deeper-details
```

## Usage
First, import the component in your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```javascript
import 'deeper-details';
```

Then, use the component in your HTML:

```html
<deeper-details
  expandButtonLabel="Show more"
  closeButtonLabel="Show less">
  <div>Content to be toggled</div>
</deeper-details>
```


### Properties
* `expandButtonLabel`: The label for the expand button. Default is "Show more".
* `closeButtonLabel`: The label for the close button. Default is "Show less".

### Slots
If you need more flexibility to style the buttons, you can replace them with your own, using slots!
* *toggler-button*: Slot for the button that toggles the content visibility.
* *close-button*: Slot for the button that hides the content.

Example:
html```
<deeper-details
  expandButtonLabel="Show more"
  closeButtonLabel="Show less">
  <button class="your-button-class" slot="toggler-button">Show more</button>
  <div>Content to be toggled</div>
