# Deeper Details custom element

This is a custom element to address one of the common frustrations with UX portfolios: Designers have different audiences, who have different amounts of interest, and different amounts of time, reading the same content.

Deeper Details addresses this challenge by making it easy to hide long, detailed text, and leaving a button that says “Tell me more.”

This is in early development and no releases are available at this time.
